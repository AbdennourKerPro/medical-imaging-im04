# Medical Image Processing (IM04)  

## Introduction  

This repository contains practical sessions focused on medical image processing, covering key techniques used in image registration and segmentation. Through these exercises, we explore different methods to analyze and process medical images, with a strong emphasis on active contours and level sets for segmentation.  

## Practical Sessions  

- **TP1 & TP2**: Introduction to image registration, a crucial step in medical imaging for aligning different images (e.g., multimodal scans, temporal sequences).  
- **TP3 & TP4**: Segmentation of medical images using active contours, exploring two approaches:  
  - Parametric representation (e.g., snakes)  
  - Geometric representation (e.g., level sets)  
- **TP5**: A segmentation challenge on human brain MRI, applying the concepts learned to extract relevant anatomical structures.  

These practical sessions provide hands-on experience with image processing techniques commonly used in medical applications, helping to develop skills in computational imaging and analysis.
